# Pneumonia_classification

This project is an attempt to learn how transfer learnig and fine tunning works to classify images.
* Datset is taken from kaggle.com
* I have used the Keras ImageDataGenerator to feed the image into my pipeline, since the dataset was quite large.
* Trained on different CNN architecture to classify pneumonai.
